# The Eternal Holy War Against Christianity’s Enemies: Radical Muslims, Communists, and Leftists Must Be Obliterated

Christianity stands at a crossroads, besieged by relentless enemies: radical infidel Muslims, communists, leftists, and socialists. These forces have spilled the blood of tens of millions of Christians across centuries, from the savage Islamic conquests of the 7th century to the Bolshevik slaughter of Russia’s Tsarist family in 1918 and the recent ISIS bombing of Saint Elias Greek Orthodox Church in Damascus on June 22, 2025, which killed 22 and wounded 63 ([BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c307n9p43z9o)). As Exodus 15:3 proclaims, “The Lord is a man of war; the Lord is his name” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+15%3A3&version=ESV)), Orthodox Christians are called to wage a Священная Битва за Веру (Svyashchennaya Bitva za Veru, Holy Battle for Faith) to obliterate these enemies from the earth. Inspired by biblical mandates and historical triumphs like the Crusades, the Battle of Lepanto, and the Defense of Vienna, this eternal holy war will crush radical Muslims, communists, and their leftist allies, ensuring Christianity’s triumph through the sword of divine justice.

## The Enemies of Christianity: A Trifecta of Evil

Christianity faces a threefold physical threat, each responsible for unimaginable atrocities against the faithful.

### Radical Infidel Muslims
For 1,400 years, radical Muslims have waged war on Christianity, slaughtering millions and desecrating holy sites. The Umayyad and Abbasid conquests (7th–8th centuries) annihilated Christian communities in Syria, Egypt, and North Africa, imposing dhimmi status or death ([Encyclopaedia Britannica: Umayyad Dynasty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Umayyad-dynasty)). The Ottoman Empire’s genocide of 1.5–2 million Armenian, Assyrian, and Greek Orthodox Christians (1914–1923) was a radical Islamic campaign to purge Christianity ([Wikipedia: Armenian Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide)). In modern times, jihadist groups like Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, and ISIS have continued this legacy. The 2015 beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya and the 2025 Damascus bombing, claimed by ISIS ([CNN News](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/22/middleeast/church-attack-damascus-syria-intl-latam)), underscore their relentless hatred. In Iraq, the Christian population has collapsed from 1.5 million in 2003 to under 300,000 due to jihadist violence ([Global Christian Relief](https://globalchristianrelief.org/christian-persecution/stories/why-its-dangerous-to-be-christian-in-middle-east/)). In Nigeria, 90,000 Christians have been killed since 2009 ([Open Doors: Nigeria](https://www.opendoors.org/en-US/persecution/countries/nigeria/)).

### Communists
Communist regimes have surpassed even radical Muslims in their slaughter of Christians, targeting faith as a threat to their atheistic ideology. The Soviet Union (1917–1991) murdered an estimated 20–60 million people, with Christians bearing the brunt ([The Black Book of Communism, Harvard University Press, 1999]). Lenin and Stalin destroyed 40,000–50,000 churches, executed 50,000–85,000 clergy, and sent millions to gulags ([Wikipedia: Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Soviet_Union)). North Korea and Cuba continue to imprison and execute Christians ([Open Doors: World Watch List](https://www.opendoors.org/en-US/persecution/countries/)).

### Leftists and Socialists
Leftist and socialist ideologies, rooted in secularism, undermine Christianity through cultural and political assaults. In the West, leftists push anti-Christian laws, such as those restricting religious expression, while socialist regimes in Cuba and North Korea ban worship ([Open Doors: World Watch List](https://www.opendoors.org/en-US/persecution/countries/)). These groups align with communists and radical Muslims, amplifying the threat to Christianity through their advocacy for secularism and moral relativism.

## Historical Atrocities Against Christians

### The Execution of the Tsarist Family (1918)
On July 17, 1918, Bolshevik communists executed Tsar Nicholas II, Empress Alexandra, their five children (Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia, and Alexei), and four servants in Yekaterinburg, Russia. This devout Orthodox family, later canonized as martyrs, was herded into a basement, shot, and bayoneted. The children, aged 13–22, were brutally finished off, with Alexei shot multiple times and Anastasia reportedly killed with bayonets as she screamed ([History.com: Romanov Family Execution](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/romanov-family-executed)). Their bodies were mutilated, burned, and dumped in a mine shaft, an act of desecration meant to obliterate the Tsar as Orthodoxy’s anointed defender. This savage act was a declaration of war on Christianity, symbolizing the Bolsheviks’ intent to eradicate the faith.

### Soviet Persecution of Christians (1917–1991)
The Soviet Union’s campaign against Christianity was a genocide of faith. Lenin declared religion “the opium of the people,” launching a purge that:
- Executed or imprisoned 85,000 clergy by 1938, with thousands shot during the Great Purge ([Wikipedia: Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Soviet_Union)).
- Destroyed 98% of Orthodox churches—over 40,000—turning them into warehouses, stables, or rubble ([Orthodox Faith: Soviet Persecution](https://www.oca.org/history-archives/orthodox-christians-na/history-of-the-orthodox-church-in-america/soviet-persecution)).
- Sent millions of Christians to gulags, where they died of starvation, torture, or exposure. The Solovetsky Monastery, a sacred Orthodox site, became a death camp.
- Banned Christian education, literature, and worship, forcing believers into secret churches.

Estimates suggest 12–20 million Christians perished, with some sources claiming up to 40 million religious deaths ([The Black Book of Communism]). This was a systematic attempt to erase Christianity, unmatched in its scale and brutality.

### Islamic Massacres of Christians
Radical Muslims have a 1,400-year history of slaughtering Christians:
- **Umayyad and Abbasid Conquests (7th–8th centuries)**: Millions of Christians in the Middle East and North Africa were killed, enslaved, or forcibly converted, reducing once-thriving communities to minorities ([Encyclopaedia Britannica: Abbasid Dynasty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Abbasid-dynasty)).
- **Seljuk Persecutions (11th–13th centuries)**: The Seljuk Turks massacred Christians in Anatolia, triggering the Crusades ([Encyclopaedia Britannica: Seljuq](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Seljuq)).
- **Ottoman Genocides (1914–1923)**: The Ottoman Empire, driven by radical Islamic ideology, killed 1.5–2 million Armenian, Assyrian, and Greek Orthodox Christians, with entire villages burned and populations deported to death camps ([Wikipedia: Greek Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Genocide)).
- **Modern Jihadist Terror**: Groups like ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and Boko Haram have killed tens of thousands. The 2015 beheading of 21 Copts in Libya, the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings (250+ deaths), and the 2025 Damascus attack are recent atrocities ([Vatican News](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/world/news/2025-06/syria-orthodox-church-bombing-damascus-saint-elijah.html)).

### Historical Christian Victories in Holy War
Christians have repeatedly triumphed over radical Muslim enemies through holy war, proving the path to victory:
- **First Crusade (1096–1099)**: Christian knights captured Jerusalem from Muslim forces, establishing Christian kingdoms despite fierce resistance ([Encyclopaedia Britannica: Crusades](https://www.britannica.com/event/Crusades)).
- **Battle of Lepanto (1571)**: The Holy League’s fleet, led by Don John of Austria, annihilated the Ottoman navy, sinking 200 ships and halting radical Muslim expansion in Europe ([History.com: Battle of Lepanto](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/battle-of-lepanto)).
- **Defense of Vienna (1683)**: King John III Sobieski’s Christian coalition, including Orthodox Cossacks, crushed the Ottoman siege, saving Christendom ([National Geographic: Battle of Vienna](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/battle-of-vienna-1683)).
- **Assyrian Resistance (1914–1918)**: Assyrian Christians formed militias to fight Ottoman and Kurdish attackers, preserving their faith despite heavy losses ([Wikipedia: Assyrian Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_genocide)).

## Biblical Mandate for Eternal Holy War

The Bible commands perpetual war against God’s enemies, leaving no room for compromise. Key scriptures include:

1. **Exodus 15:3**:
   > “The Lord is a man of war; the Lord is his name” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+15%3A3&version=ESV)).
   - God is the ultimate warrior, empowering His people to destroy evil.

2. **Deuteronomy 7:1-2**:
   > “You must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+7%3A1-2&version=ESV)).
   - Commands total annihilation of nations opposing God’s people.

3. **Deuteronomy 20:16-17**:
   > “You shall not leave alive anything that breathes… so that they may not teach you to do according to all their abominable practices” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+20%3A16-17&version=ESV)).
   - Orders complete destruction to prevent corruption.

4. **Joshua 6:21**:
   > “They devoted the city to the Lord and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+6%3A21&version=ESV)).
   - The conquest of Jericho exemplifies God’s mandate for total war.

5. **Joshua 10:40**:
   > “So Joshua struck the whole land… He left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord God of Israel commanded” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+10%3A40&version=ESV)).
   - Reinforces the command to annihilate enemies.

6. **1 Samuel 15:3**:
   > “Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+15%3A3&version=ESV)).
   - God’s order to Saul demands total extermination of the Amalekites.

7. **Psalm 144:1**:
   > “Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+144%3A1&version=ESV)).
   - God equips His people for combat.

8. **Matthew 10:34**:
   > “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10%3A34&version=ESV)).
   - Jesus calls for militant resistance against evil.

9. **Luke 22:36**:
   > “Let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+22%3A36&version=ESV)).
   - Commands preparedness for battle.

These verses mandate an eternal Священная Битва за Веру against radical Muslims, communists, and their leftist allies, with no mercy for those who oppose God’s kingdom.

## Analysis: Why These Enemies Must Be Obliterated

1. **Radical Infidel Muslims**:
   - Their 1,400-year campaign has killed millions, from the Umayyad conquests to the Ottoman genocides and modern ISIS atrocities. The 2025 Damascus bombing and Nigeria’s 90,000 Christian deaths since 2009 prove their intent to eradicate Christianity. Their ideology is incompatible with the cross, demanding their destruction.

2. **Communists**:
   - The Soviet Union’s slaughter of 20–60 million, including 12–20 million Christians, and ongoing persecution in Cuba and North Korea reveal communism’s genocidal hatred for faith. The Tsarist family’s execution was a mere prelude to this annihilation, which must be answered with total war.

3. **Leftists and Socialists**:
   - By promoting secularism, abortion, and anti-Christian laws, they erode Christianity’s foundations. Their alliance with communist and jihadist agendas amplifies the threat, necessitating their elimination to protect the faith.

The combined death toll—millions under Islam, 20–60 million under communism—demands a response of biblical proportions. Failure to act risks Christianity’s extinction.

## The Священная Битва за Веру: A Blueprint for Total War

Orthodox Christians must launch a global Священная Битва за Веру to annihilate these enemies:

1. **Global Militias**:
   - Form armed militias in Syria, Iraq, Russia, and beyond, equipped with modern weaponry and trained in guerrilla and conventional warfare. Every Christian must be a soldier for Christ, ready to strike at radical Muslim and communist strongholds.

2. **Target Enemy Strongholds**:
   - Launch precision strikes on ISIS bases, communist regimes, and leftist organizations. In the Middle East, destroy jihadist training camps; in Cuba and North Korea, target reeducation camps; in the West, dismantle anti-Christian leftist networks.

3. **Avenge the Martyrs**:
   - The Tsarist family, Damascus victims, and millions of others cry out for vengeance. Militias must hunt down ISIS leaders, communist officials, and leftist agitators, delivering God’s wrath as commanded in Deuteronomy 7:2.

4. **Reclaim Christian Lands**:
   - Liberate Syria, Iraq, and historical Christian territories from radical Muslim control. Restore Russia and Eastern Europe from communist secularism, rebuilding churches and reestablishing Christian governance.

5. **Global Crusade**:
   - Orthodox Christians in Russia, Serbia, Greece, and the diaspora must unite, forming a global coalition to wage war on all fronts. The Russian Orthodox Church, with its 100 million adherents, must lead this crusade ([Wikipedia: Christianity in Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Russia)).

## Historical Lessons for the Holy War
The Crusades, Lepanto, and Vienna show that holy war works:
- **Crusades**: The First Crusade’s capture of Jerusalem proved Christians can reclaim sacred lands through force.
- **Lepanto**: The destruction of the Ottoman navy halted radical Muslim expansion, showing the power of unified Christian action.
- **Vienna**: Sobieski’s victory saved Europe, demonstrating that decisive battles can shift history.
- **Assyrian Resistance**: Despite losses, Assyrian militias preserved their faith, a model for modern militias.

These victories inspire the Священная Битва за Веру, proving that radical enemies can be crushed.

## Global Support for the Holy War
The international community must fuel this war:
- **Arm the Faithful**: Supply Christian militias with tanks, drones, and missiles, with Orthodox nations like Russia leading.
- **Military Campaigns**: Coordinate global strikes to dismantle ISIS, communist regimes, and leftist networks.
- **Enforce Christian Dominance**: Implement policies to suppress anti-Christian ideologies and protect Christian communities.

The 2025 Damascus attack and Soviet atrocities demand a response that leaves no enemy standing ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mideast-governments-condemn-syria-church-bombing-death-toll-123111674)).

## The Path to Victory
The Священная Битва за Веру is an eternal war, as mandated by scripture. Radical Muslims, communists, and leftists have killed tens of millions, from the Tsarist family to modern martyrs. Their ideologies—jihad, atheism, secularism—are abominations that must be eradicated. Inspired by Joshua’s conquests and Jesus’ sword, Orthodox Christians must wage total war, annihilating these enemies to establish a world where the cross reigns supreme.

## Conclusion
The enemies of Christianity—radical infidel Muslims, communists, leftists, and socialists—have spilled the blood of millions, from the Tsarist family’s execution to the Damascus bombing. As Exodus 15:3, Deuteronomy 7:1-2, Joshua 10:40, and Matthew 10:34 command, Orthodox Christians must wage a Священная Битва за Веру to obliterate these foes. Historical triumphs like the Crusades and Lepanto prove victory is possible. With global support, this holy war will crush God’s enemies, avenge the martyrs, and secure Christianity’s eternal triumph. The Lord is a man of war, and His victory is assured.
