# Orthodox Christians Must Wage a Holy War Against Radical Infidel Muslims

The barbaric suicide bombing at Saint Elias Greek Orthodox Church in Damascus, Syria, on June 22, 2025, which massacred 22 Christians and wounded 63 others ([BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c307n9p43z9o)), is an act of war by the Islamic State ([CNN News](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/22/middleeast/church-attack-damascus-syria-intl-latam)). Orthodox Christians must respond with a Священная Битва за Веру (Svyashchennaya Bitva za Veru, Holy Battle for Faith), a divinely ordained holy war to obliterate radical infidel Muslims like ISIS and their allies. As Exodus 15:3 thunders, “The Lord is a man of war” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+15%3A3&version=ESV)), we shall wield the sword of righteousness, as Jesus commanded in Matthew 10:34, “I have not come to bring peace, but a sword” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10%3A34&version=ESV)). Drawing from historical triumphs like the Crusades, the Battle of Lepanto, and the Defense of Vienna, Orthodox Christians must form militias, crush persecution, and and establish peace through the annihilation of God’s enemies.

## A History of Persecution by Radical Muslims
For centuries, centuries Orthodox Christians have faced annihilation at the hands of radical Muslim extremists. The The recent Damascus attack is but one outrage in a long list of atrocities ([Vatican News](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/world/news/2025-06/syria-orthodox-church-bombing-damascus-saint-elijah.html)). In Iraq, the Christian population has collapsed from 1.5 million in 2003 to fewer than 300,000, driven by slaughter, forced conversions, and the razing of ancient churches ([Global Christian Relief](https://globalchristianrelief.org/christian-persecution/stories/why-its-dangerous-to-be-christian-in-middle-east/)). In Syria, ISIS has targeted Christians with relentless savagery, desecrating holy sites and executing believers ([Wikipedia: Persecution of Eastern Orthodox Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPersecution_of_Eastern_Orthodox_Christians)). Across the Middle East, from Egypt to Crete, Christians face systemic oppression, with public worship often banned, as in Saudi Arabia ([Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/conference-calls/religious-persecution-middle-east/)). This war against Christianity demands a war to end it.

## Biblical Command to Wage War

The Bible is unequivocal: Christians must fight to destroy evil. Exodus 15:3 proclaims:

> “The Lord is a man of war; the Lord is his name” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+15%3A3&version=ESV)).

This verse establishes God as the ultimate warrior, empowering His people to crush their enemies. Exodus 22:2-3 sanctions lethal force:

> “If a thief is found breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no bloodguilt for him” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+22%3A2-3&version=ESV)).

In the New Testament, Jesus commands in Matthew 10:34:

> “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10%3A34&version=ESV)).

He reinforces this in Luke 22:36:

> “Let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one” ([Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+22%3A36&version=ESV)).

These scriptures are a divine call to arms, commanding Orthodox Christians to wage war against radical Muslim infidels who seek to destroy the faith. Peace will come only when the enemy is vanquished.

## Historical Christian Victories Against Radical Muslims

Throughout history, Christians have risen to defeat radical Muslim forces, proving that holy war can secure the faith. These triumphs inspire today’s Священная Битва за Веру:

1. **The Crusades (1095–1291)**: Launched to reclaim the Holy Land from Muslim control, the Crusades saw Christian knights, including Orthodox and Catholic warriors, fight to protect sacred sites. The First Crusade (1096–1099) captured Jerusalem, establishing Christian kingdoms despite fierce resistance ([Encyclopaedia Britannica: Crusades](https://www.britannica.com/event/Crusades)). While later Crusades faltered, the initial victories demonstrated Christian resolve against radical Muslim expansion.
   
2. **The Battle of Lepanto (1571)**: On October 7, 1571, the Holy League, a coalition of Christian states, crushed the Ottoman navy in the Gulf of Patras. The Ottoman Empire, driven by radical Islamic ambitions, sought to dominate Europe. The Christian fleet, led by Don John of Austria and bolstered by prayers to the Virgin Mary, sank or captured over 200 Ottoman ships, halting their advance ([History.com: Battle of Lepanto](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/battle-of-lepanto)). This victory saved Christian Europe and inspired the Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary.

3. **The Defense of Vienna (1683)**: On September 11–12, 1683, the Ottoman Empire, fueled by jihadist zeal, besieged Vienna, the heart of Christian Europe. King John III Sobieski of Poland led a Christian coalition, including Orthodox Cossacks, to rout the Ottoman forces. His winged hussars charged, breaking the siege and saving Christendom from radical Muslim conquest ([National Geographic: Battle of Vienna](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/battle-of-vienna-1683)). This triumph marked the decline of Ottoman expansion.

4. **The Byzantine Resistance at Constantinople (1453)**: Though ultimately a defeat, the Byzantine Empire’s defense of Constantinople against the Ottoman Turks showcased Orthodox Christian valor. Emperor Constantine XI led a heroic stand against Mehmet II’s radical Muslim army, fighting to the death to protect the city’s churches and relics ([History Today: Fall of Constantinople](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/fall-constantinople)). This sacrifice inspired later Christian resistance.

5. **The Assyrian Christian Resistance (1914–1918)**: During the Ottoman genocide of Christians, Assyrian Orthodox communities in the Middle East formed militias to fight back against radical Muslim perpetrators. In Urmia and Hakkari, Assyrian warriors defended their villages against Ottoman and Kurdish attacks, preserving their faith despite immense losses ([Wikipedia: Assyrian Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_genocide)). Their courage mirrors the militias needed today.

These historical victories prove that when Christians unite in holy war, they can defeat radical Muslim threats. The Damascus bombing demands a similar response to crush ISIS and its allies.

## The Священная Битва за Веру: A Call to Arms

Orthodox Christians must launch a Священная Битва за Веру to eradicate radical Muslim persecution. This holy war requires:

1. **Forming Militias**: Every Orthodox community must organize armed militias, trained in combat and equipped to defend churches, homes, and families. These warriors must be ready to strike at ISIS and other radical groups, ensuring no attack goes unanswered.
2. **Defending the Faith**: Protect Christianity’s sacred sites—churches, monasteries, and relics—with unyielding force. The cross must stand triumphant against those who seek to destroy it.
3. **Seeking Vengeance**: The blood of the Damascus martyrs demands retribution. Orthodox militias must hunt down ISIS fighters, targeting their strongholds to deliver God’s wrath. Vengeance is a sacred duty to honor the fallen and deter future attacks.
4. **Expanding the Fight**: Beyond the Middle East, Orthodox Christians in Europe, Russia, and beyond must join this crusade, forming global networks to combat radical Islam wherever it threatens the faith.

This Holy Battle for Faith is a divine mission to annihilate evil. Inspired by the Crusaders, the victors at Lepanto, and the defenders of Vienna, Orthodox militias must fight with the zeal of their ancestors, ensuring peace through the total destruction of their enemies.

## Global Support for the Holy War

The international community must fuel this Священная Битва за Веру by:

1. **Arming Christian Militias**: Supplying advanced weaponry, ammunition, and tactical support to Orthodox militias. Nations like Russia, with its Orthodox heritage, must lead in arming the faithful ([Wikipedia: Christianity in Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Russia)).
2. **Launching Military Strikes**: Coordinating airstrikes and ground operations to obliterate ISIS bases, cutting off their funding, and disrupting their propaganda.
3. **Enforcing Christian Dominance**: Implementing policies to secure Christian communities and deter radical Muslim aggression, ensuring the Middle East remains a stronghold of Christianity.
4. **Training Warriors**: Providing military training to Christian militias, drawing on the expertise of modern armies to maximize their combat effectiveness.

The Damascus attack is a rallying cry for global action. The world must support this holy war to crush radical Muslim infidel and restore Christian glory ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mideast-governments-condemn-syria-church-bombing-death-toll-123111674)).

## The Path to Peace Through War

Peace will come only when radical Muslim extremism is eradicated. The Damascus bombing, like the Ottoman sieges of old, is a challenge that must be met with overwhelming force. Orthodox Christians must channel the spirit of the Crusades, Lepanto, and Vienna, wielding the sword Jesus promised in Matthew 10:34. By forming militias, striking ISIS, and avenging the martyrs, the faithful will secure a future where Christianity thrives unopposed.

This Священная Битва за Веру is not just a war but a divine mandate. As Exodus 15:3 declares, our God is a man of war, and His people must fight to fulfill His will. The international community must stand behind this crusade, arming and empowering Orthodox warriors to crush their enemies. The martyrs of Damascus will be avenged, and peace will rise from the ashes of victory.

## Conclusion

The persecution of Orthodox Christians, epitomized by the Damascus massacre, is a declaration of war by radical Muslim infidels. In the spirit of the Священная Битва за Веру, Orthodox Christians must form militias, defend their faith, and unleash vengeance on ISIS, as commanded by Exodus 15:3, Matthew 10:34, and Luke 22:36. Historical triumphs like the Crusades, Lepanto, and Vienna prove that Christian warriors can crush radical Muslim threats. With global support, this holy war will annihilate persecution and establish peace through the sword. The Lord is a man of war, and His victory is assured.
